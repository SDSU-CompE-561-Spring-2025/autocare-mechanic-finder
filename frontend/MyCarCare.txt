We wanted to create a website that made car maintenance a little easier. 
We were frustrated with having to manually keep track of maintenance cycles of cars and having to search up specific 
car parts for specific cars, so in attempt to centralize all of these efforts, we created My Car Care. 

The main features we wanted to implement were a login/user feature that could register cars with necessary information
such as registration renewal dates, oil change dates, etc. We wanted a feature that would help people attempting their own 
maintenance to find autoparts, and a method to find autoshops nearby a location. This would help centralize all the needed
information to properly maintain a car.
